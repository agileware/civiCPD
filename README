civiCRM Continuing Professional Development Extension

The civiCPD extension is a platform agnostic plugin that provides a continuing professional development section to a civiCRM installation that is used for professional membership management.

Once installed the Administrator has the ability to add one or more CPD categories that will be associated with CPD acivities.

Contacts will be able to access the CPD section through their user dashboard or 'My Contact Dashboard', where they can review, edit or add CPD activities and print out their CPD statement. 

Note: In order for regular users to be able to access the CPD section, the permissions of the underlying CMS must allow them to access the civiCRM Contact Dashboard and civiCRM itself.
